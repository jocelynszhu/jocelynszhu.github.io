                <p>I am a senior studying Computation and Cognition at MIT. Currently, I work with several labs across the Institute in Computational Social Research, including the <a href="https://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab">Human Cooperation Lab</a> and <a href="https://www.ccc.mit.edu/">Center for Constructive Communication.</a>. <br>
                    <br>Previously, I have interned at <a href="https://native.com/">Native Design</a> in London as an AI Technology Intern, where I researched and developed NLP applications for consumer-tech. As a Summer@EPFL Fellow, I researched task-agnostic, few-shot learning implementations for Biomedical Data at the <a href="https://brbiclab.epfl.ch/">MLBio Lab</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.
